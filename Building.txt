How to Build Lisk
-----------------

First Steps:
  You may not have the permissions to run the make bash file when downloaded over the internet.
  You can either preceed all calls to make.sh with sudo or use:
  chmod +x ./make.sh
  from the root directory of LISK


* You will find the executable project in <project>/bin *


Usage: ./make.sh <PROJECT> <OPTION>

<PROJECT> specifies the project to build. Either:
          server - build server
          client - builds client

          PLEASE NOTE: these need to be lower case

<OPTION> specifies what to do with the given project

Server options:
        -n : Build normally without debug or optimizations
        -d : Build with debug switch
        -r : Build without debug and optimizations
        -c : Removes .o files from obj/
        -f : Removes .o files from obj/ and the compiled program
